# Weather-JPMC

Hi! Thanks for checking out my weather project!

Some notes:

1. I built the Search View mainly in UIKit, and the Weather View mainly in SwiftUI
2. I used async/await wherever possible. I love how it reads as if synchronous code and I feel it's more straightforward to test
3. I stored the last searched location and any fetched images in User Defaults for simplicity
4. I used MVVM Architecture Pattern to keep UI and Functionality separate
5. It seems like I'm getting a few strange messages in the console. 
   - Given more time Iâ€™d investigate the cause and get those to stop displaying, but no current issues with functionality
   
Please let me know what you think!

Thanks,
- Dave
